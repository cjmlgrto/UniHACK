### The Problem.
You’re a busy student. You’re taking a lot of courses. They’re content-rich and staying on top of the material is a weekly struggle.

You take your lecture notes in Word or Evernote, and you might even revise key points with Anki by carefully copying them across. (Yes, manually. You deserve a medal.)

It’s awfully time-consuming, and by the time SWOT VAC rolls around, you’ve probably given it up entirely.
But what if we told you that study didn’t have to require willpower?

### The Solutions
